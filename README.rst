Sttyciar is an object-oriented, multithreaded C++ framework, built on top of pcap, for capturing and injecting packets into a TCP/IP network.

Disclaimer: the project was developed 5 years ago and needs a lot of updating. Please note in order to build it you may have to use old versions of Qt and pcap
